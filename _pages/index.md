# Hello! I'm Sruthika. 🌱



I'm a biomedical engineering student at the University of Florida, and I'm interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence in healthcare. 
As I getter better grasp of how AI technology can be applied to personalized medicine or diagnosis processes, I also want to learn about the ethical concerns of its application. 

This website will sevre as a glimpse into my mind as I explore the applcations and implications of AI in healthcare, while also exploring the practice of digital gardening. The notes I write here are setting the roots for topics I want to better understand or techniques I want to further employ. 

If you want to reach out, my [DMs are open on Twitter (@sbaviriseaty)](https://twitter.com/sbaviriseaty). Say hi! 👋
